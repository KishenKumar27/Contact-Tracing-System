# Contract Tracing System

## Project Description
This system tracks customer visits to various shops, including details such as visit times and dates during the Covid-19 period. It uses Java for implementation and CSV files for data storage. The application is designed to handle shop, customer, and check-in data, providing essential functionalities for managing and retrieving information.

## Features
1. **Manage Shops:**
   - Add, update, and retrieve shop details.
   - Track shop visits by customers.

2. **Manage Customers:**
   - Add, update, and retrieve customer details.
   - Track customer visits to shops.

3. **Visit Tracking:**
   - Record customer check-ins with timestamps.
   - Link visits to both customers and shops.

4. **File Handling:**
   - Read and write data from/to CSV files for persistence.
   - Files: `Shop.csv`, `Customers.csv`, `Checkin.csv`
